    "### Data Description:\n",
    "The dataset contains over 4000 landslide hazard points in Iran. Each point includes longitude and latitude information to help locate the point on a map. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Definition: \"Landslide point\":\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"Landslide Point\" refers to a specific geographical location that has been identified as having a heightened risk of experiencing landslides. This designation is typically based on various factors such as the area's slope, soil composition, rainfall patterns, and other environmental conditions that contribute to instability and susceptibility to landslides. Landslide points are often determined through analysis of historical landslide data, geological surveys, and climate assessments, and are used to assess and mitigate risks in vulnerable regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The dataset contains 15 columns: [descriptions taken directly off the Kaggle page]\n",
    "- `ID`\n",
    "- `LONG`: The longitude of the landslide point\n",
    "- `LAT`: The latitude of the landslide point\n",
    "- `SUB_Basin`: The name of the watershed of the landslide point\n",
    "- `Elevation`: The elevation of the landslide point from sea level (m)\n",
    "- `AAP(mm)`: The average annual precipitation at the landslide point\n",
    "- `RiverDIST(m)`: The distance of the landslide point from the river\n",
    "- `FaultDIST(m)`: The distance of the landslide point from the fault\n",
    "- `Landuse_Type`: The landuse type at the landslide point\n",
    "- `Slope(Percent)`: The slope at the landslide point (Values range from 0 to 100%)\n",
    "- `Slope(Degrees)`: The slope at the landslide point (Values range from 0 to 90)\n",
    "- `GEO_UNIT`: The geology unit of the landslide point\n",
    "- `DES_GEOUNI`: The description of the geology unit of the landslide point\n",
    "- `Climate_Type`: The climate type of the landslide point\n",
    "- `DES_ClimateType`: The description of the climate type of the landslide point\n",
    "\n",
    "All but six columns are numerical. The exceptions are:\n",
    "- `SUB_Basin`\n",
    "- `Landuse_Type`\n",
    "- `GEO_UNIT`\n",
    "- `DES_GEOUNI`\n",
    "- `Climate_Type`\n",
    "- `DES_ClimateType`\n",
    "\n",
    "All are instances of text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### First impressions:\n",
    "This dataset is very thorough, as each landslide point contains a large variety of different factors, like distance to river and fault, slope, geology unit, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "One major issue is the fact that this dataset focuses on landslide points in Iran. For this project to provide real-world benefit, the dataset would be better to contain a variety of countries' landslide risk points. Despite this setback, a workaround would be to use the information gathered here and apply it to countries and regions of similar climate and topographical setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "With regards to model building:\n",
    "- We can look into classification, where we would input a new location and determine if it is a possible landslide point. This would be valuable to predict possible landslide points.\n",
    "- We could also look into unsupervised learning, by applying KNN clustering (or something similar) to the landslide points. It would enable us to understand different categories of landslides. This could help researchers. "
